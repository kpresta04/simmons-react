			<p>
				Ernie “Pop” Simmons started a gun repair shop in 1945. Two years later
				he invented and patented the Simmons “Floating” Vent Rib for shotguns to
				improve the aim of all types of sportsmen. Over 70 years later, Simmons
				is still installing vent ribs and trying to improve your firearms
				performance in any way we can.
